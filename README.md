A custom WordPress website developed from a full Figma design with a strong focus on ADA and WCAG 2.1/2.2 accessibility compliance.  
This project includes a complete front-end implementation (HTML/CSS/JS), integration into WordPress using ACF and Contact Form 7, and multiple accessibility-driven improvements required by the client.

## 📝 Project Description
Based on the provided Figma design, I created a full HTML/CSS/JS template and then integrated it into CMS WordPress by developing a custom theme.

The website meets **digital accessibility standards**, including:
- ADA compliance  
- WCAG 2.1 & WCAG 2.2 conformance  

This was a mandatory requirement from the client, and the site structure, layout, and interactions were adapted to meet accessibility guidelines.

Additional work included:
- configuration of security protections  
- assisting the client in choosing a hosting provider  
- filling the website with content  
- preparing the site for long-term maintenance and updates  

The full project took approximately **two weeks**.
